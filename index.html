            <p>This is a game called Worm. It's very similar to the classic game Snake.</p>
            <p>The worm makes compost in the wormery it lives in. Help keep the worm and compost healthy by making sure the worm only eats things that are good for it!</p>
            <p>Bananas and cardboard are great, but plastic isn't.</p>
